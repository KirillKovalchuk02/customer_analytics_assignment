This is the code for a university assignment. The goal was to analyse the dataset (see 'clean_dataset1') of the customers of a company, which had some covariates, the assigned treatment (type of email) and whether a person clicked on the link.

The company used Thompson sampling to assign treatment, and my goal was to give additional insights and ultimately provide an alternative statistical model.

The code trains and implements Doubly Robust Learner to choose the appropriate treatment.

Note: the clean_dataset1 is only a subset of the original data that was additionally cleaned and anonimized.
